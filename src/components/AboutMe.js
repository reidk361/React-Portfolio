        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am an aspiring full-stack web developer. I received my certificate
          from the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a graduate of the University of Oregon Full Stack Web Development
          Certificate program, I have created several full stack application as
          both an individual and in a group. Those applications involved use of
          APIs, RESTful interfaces, and creating both a seamless back-end and a
          sleek and functional front end.
        </p>

          I was in the Navy for 6 years as a Reactor Operator, which required an
          eye for detail for safe reactor operations. This also involved being
          an effective communicator to avoid miscommunications during critical
          operations and being very flexible with the shipâ€™s ever-changing
          schedule.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While still in the Navy, I was also responsible for my ship's
          confidential computer system. Meaning I'm proficient in network and
          server administration in a Windows environment. After a few months in
          this division, I became the work center supervisor and, later on, the
          leading petty officer meaning that not only did I lead and mentor
          seven sailors, but I also managed our maintenance program, always
          ensuring it was inspection-ready.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          I received a Navy Achievement Medal for ensuring the successful
          transfer from paper logs to electronic logs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I also worked as a Customer Support Engineer which involved
          troubleshooting and repairing metrology tools in a clean-room
          environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All of those led me to have a solid grasp on the troubleshooting
          process, which makes me effective in detecting and fixing bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am going into web development due to a desire to expand into new
          skills that utilize my eye for detail, computer skills, and
          creativity.
